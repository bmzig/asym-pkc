# Asymmetric Public Key Cryptography

This repo contains basic implementations of asymmetric cryptographic schemes. The list curently includes:

1. [x] Elgamal
2. [x] RSA
3. [x] ECC (secp256k1)
4. [x] ECC (curve25519)

I also decided to include some digital signature algorithms, including:

1. [x] Elgamal DSA
3. [x] RSA DSA
4. [x] ECDSA
5. [ ] EdDSA - WIP
6. [x] Schnorr Signatures
