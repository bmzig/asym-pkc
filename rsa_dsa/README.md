# Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman (RSA) Digital Signature Algorithm

Like the other DSA implementations, this is just a "side" of the main PKK show. Nevertheless, the RSA digital signature was groundbreaking when it came out (it was published in the [original RSA paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)). Since then, digital signatures have been a staple of the internet age. There's not much to say about this one except that it is relatively simpler than Elgamal DSA and ECDSA, which is saying a lot since RSA has been out now for ~30 years.
